# Changelog

All notable changes to Atoll will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **AntiGravity Usage Tracking**: Track how much of Antigravity usage is left in the LLM Usage Monitor tab (both Gemini and Claude models)
- **Shelf item removal**: Hovering a Shelf item now reveals a × button that removes just that item, with a VoiceOver-accessible "Remove from Shelf" action that works without hovering (#461).
- **Shelf marquee selection**: Dragging on empty space in the Shelf now draws a rubber-band rectangle that selects every item it touches, matching Finder. Holding Shift unions the marquee with the existing selection instead of replacing it.
- **Shelf drag-out move toggle**: A new "Allow moving files when dragging out" setting (off by default) keeps drag-out copy-only. Offering a move operation previously let the receiving app relocate the original file out from under the user when the destination was on the same volume.

### Changed
- Improved the Dutch localization by adding missing translations, corrected terminology, and wording aligned with Apple's Dutch macOS conventions.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where `BluetoothHUDAnimations` (.mov files) were missing in release builds.
- Improved the GitHub Actions release workflow to use a monotonic build number allocator and automated patch versioning for stable releases.
- Fixed Cursor quota parsing and display to show the current Cursor Models and Other Models billing buckets with readable long reset durations.
- Fixed files dropped onto the Shelf silently disappearing on macOS 26 (Tahoe) by storing plain bookmarks instead of security-scoped ones, which a non-sandboxed app cannot create (#646).
- Fixed the AirPods pause gesture opening Siri instead of pausing Spotify: the real-time waveform no longer process-taps Spotify while a Bluetooth output route is active, and the tap is rebuilt whenever the output route changes.
- Fixed Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Conversation Awareness labels being clipped behind the notch in the AirPods listening-mode HUD; every mode is now trailing-aligned and scales down instead of scrolling.
- Fix crash when Apple Notes sync encounters duplicate remote note IDs
- Fixed the Shelf freezing for seconds on every drop, and dragging items out delivering the file name as plain text instead of the file itself. Four call sites bridged to `@MainActor` members of `ShelfItem` with a `Task.detached` plus `DispatchSemaphore.wait`, which deadlocks by construction when called from the main actor and always burned its full 5-second timeout: the deduplication pass in `add()` paid that cost once per existing *and* incoming item, and `createPasteboardItem` timed out to a `nil` URL and fell through to writing plain text. Resolved paths are now cached on the item at drop time (and backfilled off the main actor for items persisted earlier), so deduplication, drag-out, and the context menu need no main-actor disk I/O.
- Fixed Open, Open With, Show in Finder, Quick Look, Compress, Copy Path, and the image actions all missing from the Shelf file context menu, caused by `ShelfItem.fileURL` returning a hard-coded `nil` for files.
- Fixed the notch auto-closing in the middle of a drag and cancelling the session: dragging an item out necessarily takes the cursor off the panel, which tore down the view acting as the drag source.
